## [Brexit Party](https://thebrexitparty.org/)

No manifesto or policies on website.


## [Conservative Party](https://www.conservatives.com/)

From [Manifesto for General Election 2017](https://www.conservatives.com/manifesto) (only manifesto available):

> We need to deliver a smooth and orderly departure from the European Union and forge a deep and special partnership with our friends and allies across Europe.


## [Change UK - The Independent Group](https://voteforchange.uk/)

From [Charter for Remain](https://voteforchange.uk/charter-for-remain/):

> These elections offer you the chance to send a simple message: we want a People’s Vote and we want to remain in the European Union.


## [DUP](http://www.mydup.com/)

From [2019 European Election Manifesto](http://www.mydup.com/images/uploads/publications/European_manifesto_-_Final.pdf):

> The governments’ negotiation strategy has failed to respect the result and deliver for Northern Ireland. It needs to solve the problem of the backstop.
>
> On 23rd May, vote DUP to tell the government that we must leave the EU now.
>
> The ‘Remain’ majority in Parliament must not be allowed to disrespect the people’s choice.


## [Green Party](https://www.greenparty.org.uk/)

From [Manifesto for EU Elections 2019](https://www.greenparty.org.uk/assets/images/national-site/eu-2019/eu-manifesto-online-19-05-13.pdf) [pdf]:

> Remain in the EU, through putting the question of Brexit back to the people and mobilising a positive, pro-European movement to win the People’s Vote for Remain.


## [Labour Party](https://labour.org.uk/)

From [Manifesto for EU Elections 2019](https://labour.org.uk/manifesto/transforming-britain-and-europe/):

> Labour has put forward an alternative plan to seek a close and cooperative relationship with the European Union, including a new comprehensive customs union with a UK say, close single market alignment, guaranteed rights and standards, and the protection of the Good Friday peace agreement in Northern Ireland.
>
> We believe such a deal could bring our country back together and deliver on the result of the referendum. However, the Government has refused to listen and compromise. They have spent more of the last three years arguing among themselves than negotiating a good deal for the people of Britain.
>
> Labour will continue to oppose the Government’s bad deal or a disastrous no deal. And if we can’t get agreement along the lines of our alternative plan, or a general election, Labour backs the option of a public vote.


## [Liberal Democrats](https://www.libdems.org.uk/)

From [Manifesto](https://www.libdems.org.uk/manifesto):

> On Thursday 23rd May vote Liberal Democrat to stop Brexit.


## [Plaid Cymru](https://www.partyof.wales/)

From [EU Election 2019 "Why vote Plaid?" page](https://www.partyof.wales/plaid_europe):

> In these European elections we are demanding a referendum – to give the people a final say on whatever deal is finally agreed on exiting the European Union, with Remain firmly on the ballot paper.


## [SDLP](http://www.sdlp.ie/)

From ["Eastwood launches bid to take back John Hume’s European seat" article](http://www.sdlp.ie/news/2019/eastwood-launches-bid-to-take-back-john-humes-european-seat/):

> This is a critical election. For three years, the voice of the pro-Europe majority in Northern Ireland has been silenced, sidelined and ignored. That ends here and it ends now. This campaign is an opportunity to reassert our demand to remain in the European Union


## [Sinn Féin](https://www.sinnfein.ie/)

From [Brexit policy page](https://www.sinnfein.ie/brexit):

> On 23rd June 2016 the people of the North voted to remain in the EU. They did so because it is in their best interests politically and economically. Brexit poses a huge threat to the future of the people of Ireland in terms of a land border on the island, the north being forced out of the single market, barriers to trade, potential devastation of agriculture, not to mention the implications for the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement.
>
> Sinn Féin has argued that the only credible approach is for the north to be designated special status within the EU and for the whole island of Ireland to remain within the EU together. There is widespread support for such a position and it can be delivered in the Brexit negotiations. The EU has shown itself to be flexible in dealing with different forms of integration and different forms of relationships for member states and non-member states.


## [SNP](https://www.snp.org/)

From [EU Election 2019 campaign page](https://www.snp.org/campaigns/eu-election-2019/):

> Scotland is being dragged out of the European Union against our will.
>
> The people of Scotland have been ignored, the Scottish Parliament has been ignored. And, most important of all, the future prosperity of the next generation of Scots has been put in danger.
>
> Now, these European elections are Scotland’s chance to make our voice heard. To send a message that we will not accept a Brexit process that silences Scotland, treats our Parliament and Government with contempt and fails to represent the interests of people in Scotland. Scotland’s future belongs in Europe.
